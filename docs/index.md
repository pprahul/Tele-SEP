An early warning system for sepsis called the Tele-Sepsis Prediction Engine (Tele-SEP), uses plug-and-play machine learning algorithms to compute intrinsic correlations between the changes in vital signs, designed to predict sepsis up to six hours prior to its onset. Tele-SEP was trained and validated on independent datasets drawn from the widely accepted MIMIC-II database.

### Input data
Input to Tele-SEP can be hourly measurements of any one or a combination of the following vital parameters:
- heart rate
- SpO2 (blood oxygen)
- respiratory rate
- temperature

The input should be formatted so that the measurements span a minimum of 3 hours and a maximum of 6 hours.

### Output
Tele-SEP model predicts the probability of occurance of sepsis based on the input vital parameter measurements.

### Trained Models
Pre-trained XGBoost models for different lead times of prediction ranging from 3 hour to 6 hours is provided for use.

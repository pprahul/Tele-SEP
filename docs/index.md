## Tele-SEP

The early warning system for sepsis called the Tele-Sepsis Prediction Engine (Tele-SEP), uses plug-and-play machine learning algorithms to compute intrinsic correlations between the changes in vital signs, designed to predict sepsis up to six hours prior to its onset. Tele-SEP was trained and validated on independent datasets drawn from the widely accepted MIMIC-II database.
